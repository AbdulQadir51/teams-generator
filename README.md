I have a command-line program that accepts user input. Upon entering the team members and their information, I receive a nicely formatted HTML file which displays a team roster based on the input I provide. My default email program opens when I click on one of the addresses, and the TO field is populated with the address I clicked. If I click the GitHub username, the GitHub profile opens in a new tab; if I open the application, I am prompted to enter the team manager's name, employee ID, email address, and office number; if I enter the team manager's name, employee ID, email address, and office number, I am presented with the option of adding an engineer or intern or to finish building my team. I'm prompted to enter the engineer's name, ID, email, and GitHub username when I select the engineer option. Once I have entered those details, I am taken back to the menu.The intern's name, ID, email address, and school are required when I select the intern option. After submitting the application, I exit
